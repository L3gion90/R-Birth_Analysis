# R-Birth_Analysis

For this medical study, data collected from 3 hospitals, concerning 2500 infants, were analysed.  
In particular, the following variables were noted:  
- age of the mother
- number of pregnancies sustained
- Smoking mother (0=NO, YES=1)
- number of weeks of gestation
- weight in grams of the newborn
- Length in mm of newborn baby
- Diameter of baby's skull in mm
- Type of delivery: Natural or Caesarean
- Hospital: 1, 2, 3
- Sex of baby: M or F  

The aim is to find out whether it is possible to predict the weight of the newborn at birth given all the other variables.  
In particular, you want to investigate a relationship with the mother's variables, to see whether or not they have a significant effect, such as the potentially harmful effect of smoking
